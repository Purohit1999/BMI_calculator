## 🔍 Project Overview
The BMI Calculator is an interactive web app designed to calculate users' Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms). It includes a draggable form interface with immersive video and audio backgrounds to enhance user engagement. Users receive instant feedback on their BMI category (underweight, healthy weight, overweight) based on the calculated result.

### Key Functionalities
- Calculate BMI with height in centimeters and weight in kilograms.
- Draggable form for flexibility on the page.
- Interactive background with video, image transitions, and audio.
- Display BMI categories with corresponding health advice.

## 🎨 UX/UI Design

### 🎯 Project Goals
The BMI Calculator aims to provide users with an engaging experience while calculating their BMI. The form and background video are designed to create an immersive, user-friendly interface.

- **Interactivity**: Real-time updates and animations enhance engagement.
- **Clarity**: Minimalist design keeps the focus on functionality.
- **Accessibility**: Transparent, movable form for better visibility and access.
- **Responsiveness**: Adapts to various device screen sizes for ease of use.

### 👥 User Goals
- Quickly and accurately calculate BMI.
- Receive visual and numerical feedback on BMI results.
- Enjoy a visually appealing, interactive experience.

## 🌈 Colour Scheme

The color scheme is chosen to reflect a professional yet energetic tone:
- **Primary**: Teal for button elements.
- **Secondary**: White with opacity for the form background.
- **Accent**: Blue for highlighted BMI results.

## 🖋️ Typography

- **Font Family**: `Poppins`, sans-serif for modern and clean readability.
- **Font Sizes**: Slightly larger font for headings and BMI results to maintain visibility across screen sizes.

## 👤 User Stories

### 🧑‍💻 As a User, I want to:
1. **Easily input my height and weight** and see my BMI calculated instantly.
2. **Understand my BMI category** based on the result (underweight, healthy weight, overweight).
3. **Interact with the page** while enjoying a smooth, visually immersive background.

## 🖼️ Imagery & Media
The project includes:
- **Background Video**: A slow-motion gym video for dynamic ambiance.
- **Zoom and Pan Image Effect**: Transition to an image with subtle zoom/pan after the video.
- **Audio**: Background gym sounds to add atmosphere.

## 📐 Wireframes

The wireframes illustrate the responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. This project layout includes a centrally placed form with a responsive, interactive background.

## 🎭 Design Choices

The design is focused on clarity and interactivity, allowing users to move the form freely on the screen. The transparent form overlays a background video, creating an immersive experience without obstructing the BMI functionality.

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design**: The form and background adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Draggable Form**: Users can reposition the form for optimal viewing.
- **BMI Calculation**: Calculates BMI based on metric units (height in cm and weight in kg).
- **Background Animation**: Video with zoom/pan image transitions, adding visual appeal.
- **Audio Playback**: Background sounds for an immersive experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### 🌐 Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage, including the form elements.
- **CSS3**: Styling for responsive design, animations, and transparency effects.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Handles BMI calculation, form interaction, and background effects.

### 🎨 Design Tools
- **Google Fonts**: `Poppins` font for consistent and modern typography.
- **Font Awesome**: Icons used for visual indicators in the form.

## 🧪 Testing

### Testing Overview
The project was tested across devices and browsers to ensure functionality, responsiveness, and visual integrity. Key tests included:

- **BMI Calculation Accuracy**: Verified formula accuracy.
- **Form Dragging**: Ensured smooth dragging across devices.
- **Video and Audio Sync**: Confirmed smooth playback and transitions between video and image backgrounds.

### Validation
